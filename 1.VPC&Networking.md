# AWS Notes: VPC and Security Groups (Advanced Notes)

## üß± What is VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a **logically isolated section** of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment.

### üìå Key Components of a VPC:

#### 1. **CIDR Block (IPv4 and IPv6)**

* Defines the range of IP addresses for your VPC.
* Example: `10.0.0.0/16` allows 65,536 private IP addresses.
* IPv6 can be optionally enabled (useful for internet-facing applications).

#### 2. **Subnets**

* A VPC is divided into **subnets** to place resources in different **availability zones** or **security zones**.
* **Public Subnet**: Has access to the Internet via an Internet Gateway.
* **Private Subnet**: No direct access to the Internet (typically used for databases, application logic).
* Subnet CIDRs must fall within the VPC‚Äôs CIDR block.

#### 3. **Route Tables**

* Controls how network traffic is directed.
* Every subnet must be associated with a **route table**.
* Public subnets route traffic to the **Internet Gateway**.
* Private subnets route traffic to the **NAT Gateway** (for outbound internet).

#### 4. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

* A horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component.
* Allows resources in a public subnet to connect to the internet.
* Must be explicitly attached to your VPC.

#### 5. **NAT Gateway / NAT Instance**

* Used for **private subnet instances** to access the internet **without exposing** them.
* NAT Gateway is managed by AWS (preferred over NAT Instance).
* Placed in a **public subnet** with a route from private subnet pointing to it.

#### 6. **Elastic IP (EIP)**

* A static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
* Used for associating with NAT Gateway, EC2 instances, etc.

#### 7. **VPC Peering**

* Allows routing traffic between two VPCs.
* Works across regions and accounts.
* No transitive peering (VPC-A peered with B, and B with C does not allow A ‚Üî C).

#### 8. **Endpoints (Interface & Gateway)**

* **Interface Endpoint**: Connect to AWS services over private network using private IP.
* **Gateway Endpoint**: Target specific AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB) via private routing.

#### 9. **DHCP Options Set**

* Custom configuration for DNS name resolution (e.g., using custom DNS server).

## üîê What are Security Groups?

A **Security Group (SG)** is a set of firewall rules that **control traffic** to and from AWS resources like EC2 instances.

### üéØ Key Properties:

* **Stateful**: Return traffic is automatically allowed.
* Applied at the **instance/network interface** level.
* Cannot block traffic (no deny rules), only **allow**.

### üßæ Rule Types:

#### ‚úÖ Inbound Rules:

* Define what traffic is allowed **to** the instance.
* Example: Allow TCP port 22 for SSH from a specific IP.

#### ‚úÖ Outbound Rules:

* Define what traffic is allowed **from** the instance to other services or internet.
* By default, all outbound traffic is allowed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Port Examples:

| Service    | Protocol | Port   |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| SSH        | TCP      | 22     |
| HTTP       | TCP      | 80     |
| HTTPS      | TCP      | 443    |
| Custom App | TCP/UDP  | custom |

### üí° Best Practices:

* Use **least privilege** model.
* Restrict access to specific IP ranges.
* Use **security group names** that clearly define purpose (e.g., `web-sg`, `db-sg`).
* Avoid `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH unless behind a VPN.
* Combine with **Network ACLs** for extra control.

## üîÑ Differences Between VPC and Security Groups:

| Feature             | VPC                                  | Security Group                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Role                | Network-level isolation              | Resource-level firewall            |
| Configuration Level | Entire network                       | Individual EC2 instance or service |
| Rules               | Routes and access (via subnets, IGW) | Inbound and outbound permissions   |
| Stateful?           | N/A                                  | Yes                                |
| Scope               | Applies to all AWS network services  | Applied to EC2, RDS, ENI, etc.     |

## üõ† Hands-On Example:

1. **Create a Custom VPC**:

   * CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`
   * Enable DNS hostnames and support
2. **Create Two Subnets**:

   * Public Subnet: `10.0.1.0/24`
   * Private Subnet: `10.0.2.0/24`
3. **Create and Attach Internet Gateway**
4. **Create Route Table and Associate with Public Subnet**:

   * Route: `0.0.0.0/0` ‚Üí IGW
5. **Launch EC2 in Public Subnet**:

   * Assign Elastic IP
   * Attach Security Group with:

     * Inbound: SSH (22) from your IP
     * Inbound: HTTP (80) from anywhere
6. **Optional**: Create NAT Gateway for Private Subnet
7. **Test**:

   * SSH into EC2
   * Host static site on port 80

## ‚úÖ Summary:

* **VPC** = Logical Network Boundary
* **Security Group** = Instance-level Firewall
* Mastery of both is essential for secure AWS architecture.
* Start simple, then layer with complexity (NATs, Endpoints, Peering).
