## üìå What is Amazon EKS?

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a **fully managed Kubernetes service** by AWS that simplifies the process of running Kubernetes on AWS infrastructure. It handles:

* Control plane provisioning and scalability
* Automatic upgrades and patches
* Integration with AWS services (IAM, VPC, ELB, CloudWatch)
* Security hardening and compliance

üü© **Why use EKS?**

* You get the power and flexibility of Kubernetes without managing master/control plane components.
* Seamless integration with AWS IAM for authentication.
* Native support for networking, load balancing, storage, and security.

## üéØ Core Kubernetes Concepts (Essential for EKS)

Understanding Kubernetes fundamentals is necessary for working with EKS. Here's a refresher:

| Concept                | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pod**                | The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It wraps one or more containers.            |
| **Deployment**         | Manages replica sets and rolling updates of pods.                                       |
| **Service**            | Defines how to expose pods: ClusterIP (internal), NodePort, or LoadBalancer (external). |
| **ConfigMap & Secret** | Inject configuration or sensitive data into applications.                               |
| **Namespace**          | Logical separation of resources within a cluster.                                       |
| **Ingress**            | HTTP routing to services (like a URL path-based gateway).                               |

---

## üèóÔ∏è Amazon EKS Architecture

EKS divides responsibilities into two planes:

| Plane             | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control Plane** | Managed by AWS. Includes etcd, API server, scheduler, controller manager. |
| **Data Plane**    | The worker nodes (EC2 or Fargate) where containers run. You manage these. |

**Key EKS Components:**

* EKS Cluster (Control Plane)
* Worker Nodes (EC2 instances or Fargate tasks)
* Node Groups (scalable collections of worker nodes)
* kubelet (runs on each node, registers the node with the cluster)
* IAM for authentication & authorization
* ALB/NLB for ingress and service exposure

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization in EKS

* **IAM ‚Üí Kubernetes Authentication**: AWS IAM users/roles are mapped to Kubernetes RBAC users/groups via `aws-auth` ConfigMap.
* **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**: Lets individual pods access AWS services securely without using EC2 role permissions.
* RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) applies to Kubernetes permissions once the IAM identity is mapped.

üß† **Interview Tip:** Be ready to explain how IAM roles are linked to Kubernetes service accounts using IRSA for secure AWS access from pods.

## üß∞ Tooling Ecosystem

| Tool                | Role                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **kubectl**         | CLI to manage Kubernetes clusters               |
| **eksctl**          | CLI tool to create and manage EKS clusters      |
| **Helm**            | Package manager for Kubernetes applications     |
| **AWS CLI**         | AWS command-line interface to interact with EKS |
| **Terraform / CDK** | Infrastructure as code to automate EKS setup    |

## üß™ Deployment Patterns in EKS

### 1. **Monolithic ‚Üí Microservices**

* EKS is ideal for containerizing and deploying independently scalable services.
* Promotes 12-factor app principles.

### 2. **EC2 Worker Nodes vs Fargate**

| EC2                                                 | Fargate                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Full control over instance types, AMIs, autoscaling | Serverless node provisioning               |
| Best for workloads with specific resource needs     | Great for unpredictable or burst workloads |
| Requires managing instance lifecycle                | AWS handles everything                     |

---

## üåê Networking in EKS

* Each pod gets an IP address from the VPC using **VPC CNI plugin**.
* **Security Groups** control access at instance level.
* **Network Policies** (Kubernetes) control pod-to-pod communication (requires enabling Calico or similar).
* **Load Balancers**: EKS integrates with ELB, ALB, and NLB out of the box.

üß† **Interview Tip:** Be ready to discuss how Kubernetes Services of type `LoadBalancer` provision ELBs automatically in EKS.

---

## üèóÔ∏è High Availability & Scaling

* EKS Control Plane is highly available (multi-AZ).
* Worker nodes are deployed in multiple AZs for redundancy.
* **Cluster Autoscaler** and **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** allow dynamic scaling.
* Supports multi-cluster and multi-region architectures for resiliency.

---

## üì¶ Application Deployment in EKS

### Typical Steps:

1. **Build Docker image**
2. **Push to Amazon ECR**
3. **Create Deployment & Service YAMLs**
4. **Apply manifests using kubectl**
5. **(Optional)** Use Ingress + ALB Controller for HTTP routing
6. **(Optional)** Use Helm charts for templated, reusable deployments

---

## üß≠ Monitoring and Logging

* **Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights**: Cluster, node, pod-level metrics
* **Fluentd / Fluent Bit**: For forwarding logs from pods to CloudWatch or ELK
* **kubectl top / logs / describe**: CLI-level diagnostics
* **Prometheus + Grafana**: Advanced observability stack (often installed via Helm)

üß† **Interview Tip:** Understand how metrics collection and logging differ from VM-based deployments and how CloudWatch integrates.

---

## üìç CI/CD in EKS

* Use **CodePipeline**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Jenkins** to automate deployments.
* GitOps with **ArgoCD** or **Flux** is widely adopted.
* Best practice: Use **Helm** or **Kustomize** for deployment automation and parameterization.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

* Use **IRSA** for least-privilege access to AWS services.
* Apply **RBAC** strictly per namespace or team.
* Use **Secrets Manager** or **AWS Parameter Store** to manage sensitive data.
* Keep nodes updated (managed node groups simplify this).
* Enable audit logging in EKS for compliance and debugging.

## üìù Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is EKS and how does it differ from ECS?

**A:** EKS is Kubernetes-compatible, open-source standard. ECS is AWS-native with its own scheduler and orchestrator. EKS is better for teams familiar with Kubernetes.

---

### Q2: How does IAM work in EKS?

**A:** IAM is used for authentication (access to cluster), then Kubernetes RBAC is used for authorization. IRSA is used to allow pods to access AWS services securely.

---

### Q3: What is IRSA?

**A:** IAM Roles for Service Accounts. It maps a Kubernetes service account to an IAM role via OpenID Connect (OIDC). Ensures pod-level permission granularity.

---

### Q4: How do you scale applications in EKS?

**A:** Use:

* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for pod scaling
* Cluster Autoscaler for node scaling
* Manage node group capacity (manual or auto-scaling group)

---

### Q5: How are Load Balancers used in EKS?

**A:** Services of type `LoadBalancer` provision ELB/NLB. Ingress resources with ALB Controller enable path-based routing via Application Load Balancers.

---

### Q6: Difference between EC2 and Fargate in EKS?

**A:** EC2 gives full control over node type and lifecycle. Fargate is serverless and auto-manages compute but has limited control. Choose based on workload type.

---

### Q7: How do you troubleshoot issues in EKS?

**A:** Use:

* `kubectl describe` for events and pod status
* `kubectl logs` for logs
* CloudWatch Container Insights for metrics
* `kubectl get events` for cluster-wide events
