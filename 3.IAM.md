# 🔐 AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Complete Notes

## 🧭 What is IAM?

**AWS IAM** is a service that enables you to **securely manage access** to AWS services and resources.

IAM answers:

* **Who** can access what?
* **What** actions can they perform?
* **Which** resources can they access?

> IAM is **global**, not tied to a region.

---

## 🌟 Why IAM Is Important

* ✅ Enforces **least privilege** principle
* 🛡 Protects critical infrastructure
* 🔍 Enables auditing with CloudTrail
* 🔄 Allows secure **temporary access**
* 🔐 Avoids hardcoded credentials

---

## 🔑 Core Components of IAM

### 1. **IAM Users**

* Represent **humans or applications**
* Have **long-term credentials** (password, access keys)
* Can be assigned **policies** (permissions)

📌 Example: `john-dev` IAM user to access EC2

---

### 2. **IAM Groups**

* A **collection of users**
* **Policies attached to groups** apply to all members

📌 Example: Group `Developers` with EC2 + S3 permissions

---

### 3. **IAM Policies**

* Define **permissions using JSON**
* Specify:

  * `Effect` – Allow or Deny
  * `Action` – What can be done (`ec2:StartInstances`)
  * `Resource` – Which resource

📘 Example policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Types of Policies:

* ✅ **AWS Managed Policies** – Created by AWS
* 🧰 **Customer Managed Policies** – You define them
* 🗂 **Inline Policies** – Directly attached to a user/group/role

---

### 4. **IAM Roles**

* Temporary identities with **permissions**
* Can be **assumed** by trusted AWS services, users, or apps
* Provide **temporary credentials**

> IAM Roles are ideal for **EC2, Lambda, ECS**, and **cross-account access**

---

### 5. **Trust Policies**

* Defines **who can assume** the role (like EC2, Lambda, federated users)

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Examples

### 📦 EC2 + S3 Access via IAM Role

#### Step 1: Create Role

* Go to IAM → Roles → Create
* Select **EC2** as trusted entity
* Attach policy: `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`
* Name: `EC2S3ReadOnlyRole`

#### Step 2: Launch EC2 with this Role

#### Step 3: Test in EC2

```bash
aws s3 ls     # Works without access keys!
```

---

### 🧪 Lambda Accessing DynamoDB

#### Step 1: Create Role

* Trusted entity: Lambda
* Attach: `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`

#### Step 2: Assign Role to Lambda Function

## 🤝 IAM Role Use Cases

| Use Case               | Description                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| EC2 access to S3       | Assign IAM Role to instance |
| Lambda writing to RDS  | Role with RDS policy        |
| Cross-account access   | Use STS + assume-role       |
| GitHub CI/CD to deploy | IAM Role via OIDC           |
| Mobile apps access AWS | Use Cognito + IAM roles     |

## 🔐 Best Practices for IAM

✅ **Use IAM Roles** instead of storing credentials
✅ **Enable MFA** for all users
✅ **Use least privilege** principle
✅ **Rotate credentials**
✅ Use **groups** instead of assigning to users
✅ Monitor with **CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer**

## 🧠 IAM Summary Table

| Component          | Purpose                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| IAM User           | Long-term identity (password + keys)   |
| IAM Group          | Logical grouping of users              |
| IAM Policy         | Defines what actions are allowed       |
| IAM Role           | Temporary identity, assumed by trusted |
| Trust Policy       | Who can assume this role               |
| Permissions Policy | What the role/user/group can do        |
