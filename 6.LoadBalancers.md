# üìò AWS Load Balancer (ELB) ‚Äì Complete Notes

---

## üîç What is a Load Balancer?

A **Load Balancer** is a service that **distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets** (like EC2 instances, containers, IPs) to ensure **high availability**, **scalability**, and **fault tolerance**.

In AWS, this is handled by **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Load Balancers in AWS

AWS provides **four types** of load balancers under the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service:

| Load Balancer Type        | Layer | Protocols                | Use Case                           |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Application (ALB)**     | 7     | HTTP, HTTPS              | Web applications, REST APIs        |
| **Network (NLB)**         | 4     | TCP, UDP, TLS            | High-performance, low latency apps |
| **Gateway Load Balancer** | 3     | All IP traffic (Layer 3) | Used with firewalls, appliances    |
| **Classic (CLB)**         | 4/7   | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP         | Legacy applications (deprecated)   |

> üî• **Preferred Choices**:
>
> * Use **ALB** for most modern HTTP-based apps
> * Use **NLB** for gaming, VoIP, or financial applications
> * Use **GWLB** for security appliances
> * Avoid using **CLB** for new apps

## üí° Why Use Load Balancers?

* **Distribute traffic** across multiple backend targets
* **Auto failover**: Redirect to healthy instances
* **Scalability**: Works with Auto Scaling Groups
* **Security**: Integrates with IAM, TLS, WAF
* **Seamless deployments**: Blue-green or canary deployments

---

## üì¶ Core Concepts

### 1. **Target Group**

* A group of resources (EC2, Lambda, IPs) the LB will forward traffic to.
* **Health checks** are configured per target group.
* ALBs/NLBs can route traffic to multiple target groups based on rules.

### 2. **Listener**

* Listens for client requests (e.g., on port 80 or 443).
* Each listener has **rules** that define how to route requests.

### 3. **Rules**

* Define how traffic is forwarded (e.g., path-based `/api/*` or host-based `api.example.com` routing).

### 4. **Health Checks**

* Load balancer periodically pings targets.
* If a target fails, it's removed from routing until it recovers.

### 5. **Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)**

* Binds a user to a specific target to maintain session data.
* ALBs support this using cookies.

### 6. **SSL Termination**

* TLS encryption handled at the Load Balancer level.
* Offloads encryption from backend servers (reduces load).

---

## üåê Application Load Balancer (ALB)

* Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Advanced routing: host-based and path-based
* Can route to Lambda, ECS, EC2, IP addresses
* Supports WebSockets and HTTP/2
* **Good for microservices, REST APIs, SPA (React/Angular apps)**

### Example:

```plaintext
GET api.mysite.com/user ‚Üí Target Group 1 (User Service)
GET api.mysite.com/order ‚Üí Target Group 2 (Order Service)
```

---

## ‚ö° Network Load Balancer (NLB)

* Layer 4 (TCP, UDP, TLS)
* Ultra-low latency
* Handles millions of requests per second
* Supports static IP addresses
* Can preserve source IP (good for compliance)

> **Best for real-time systems, games, messaging apps**

---

## üõ° Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

* Operates at Layer 3 (IP)
* Used to deploy **third-party virtual appliances** (firewalls, intrusion detection systems)
* Integrates with traffic inspection tools

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Classic Load Balancer (CLB) \[Legacy]

* Supports Layer 4 (TCP) and Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Limited features compared to ALB and NLB
* Not recommended for new applications

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation ‚Äì ALB Example

### üîß Step-by-step Setup:

1. **Create Target Group**

   * Go to EC2 ‚Üí Target Groups ‚Üí Create
   * Choose instance or IP type, protocol, port (e.g., HTTP:80)
   * Define health check path (`/health`)

2. **Launch EC2 Instances**

   * Launch instances in the same VPC and attach to target group

3. **Create ALB**

   * Go to EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers ‚Üí Create Application Load Balancer
   * Choose scheme: internet-facing or internal
   * Select subnets (min 2 AZs recommended)
   * Add security group allowing port 80/443

4. **Configure Listener**

   * Add HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443)
   * Forward to the target group

5. **Test Setup**

   * Open DNS of ALB in browser (e.g., `http://my-alb-123456.elb.amazonaws.com`)
   * Should route traffic to your EC2 instances

---

## üîê Security & Integration

* **Security Groups**: Must allow inbound traffic from LB on instance ports
* **WAF**: Attach AWS Web Application Firewall to ALB
* **ACM**: Use AWS Certificate Manager to create/upload TLS certs for HTTPS
* **CloudWatch**: Monitor latency, target health, request count
* **Auto Scaling**: ELB integrates directly to add/remove instances dynamically

## üìà Monitoring and Logs

| Feature                | Available? | Notes                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Access Logs**        | ‚úÖ          | Store HTTP requests in S3 for ALB & CLB   |
| **CloudWatch Metrics** | ‚úÖ          | Monitor requests count, latency, etc.     |
| **Health Check Logs**  | ‚úÖ          | Identify why targets are marked unhealthy |
| **X-Forwarded-For**    | ‚úÖ          | Captures client IP address in header      |

## üìä Interview-Oriented FAQs

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between ALB and NLB?

* ALB works at Layer 7, supports content-based routing (e.g., `/images`, `/api`)
* NLB works at Layer 4, supports TCP/UDP, high performance, static IPs

### ‚úÖ Can Load Balancer connect to Lambda?

* Yes, **ALB** supports Lambda as a target

### ‚úÖ How does AWS ELB perform health checks?

* It sends periodic requests (e.g., `GET /health`) and removes targets if they fail.

### ‚úÖ Does ELB store session data?

* No. But ALB supports **Sticky Sessions** via cookies.

### ‚úÖ Can I use HTTPS on Load Balancer?

* Yes, with **SSL termination**. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to install certs.
