# AWS Notes: EC2 and Related Services

## üñ•Ô∏è What is Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)?

Amazon EC2 provides **resizable compute capacity** in the cloud. It allows you to launch **virtual machines (instances)** on-demand, with full control over the operating system, networking, and storage.

---

## üöÄ Key Concepts of EC2:

### 1. **EC2 Instance**

* A virtual server running on AWS.
* You can choose OS (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, etc.), CPU, RAM, and storage.

### 2. **Instance Types**

* Based on the type of workload:

  * `t2.micro`, `t3.medium`: General purpose
  * `m5.large`: Balanced
  * `c5.large`: Compute-optimized
  * `r5.large`: Memory-optimized

### 3. **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**

* Blueprint of the instance (OS + App).
* You can use pre-built AMIs or create custom ones.

### 4. **Instance Lifecycle**

* `Pending` ‚Üí `Running` ‚Üí `Stopped` ‚Üí `Terminated`
* You pay per second/minute (depending on type) while in running state.

### 5. **Elastic IP**

* Static public IP address you can assign to an EC2 instance.

### 6. **Key Pairs**

* SSH credentials used to log in to Linux EC2 instances.
* `.pem` file must be kept secure.

---

## üîê Security with EC2:

* Security Groups: Acts like a firewall for the instance.
* Key Pair: Protects SSH access.
* IAM Roles: Attach roles to EC2 to access AWS services securely.

---

## üì¶ Storage Options for EC2:

### 1. **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

* Persistent block storage attached to EC2.
* Survives reboots.

### 2. **Instance Store**

* Temporary storage (ephemeral).
* Data lost on stop/terminate.

### 3. **EFS (Elastic File System)**

* Shared file system across multiple instances (like NFS).

---

## üß∞ EC2 Related Services

### 1. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**

* Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
* Types:

  * **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
  * **NLB (Network Load Balancer)**: Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
  * **CLB (Classic)**: Legacy

### 2. **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**

* Automatically increase/decrease EC2 instances based on demand.
* Works with CloudWatch alarms (CPU usage, etc.).
* Helps achieve high availability.

### 3. **Elastic Beanstalk**

* Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).
* Automatically handles deployment, capacity, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring.
* Supports Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, .NET, Go, and Docker.

### 4. **Launch Templates and Launch Configurations**

* Define instance settings (AMI, type, SG, Key Pair) used in Auto Scaling or manual launch.

### 5. **EC2 Image Builder**

* Automate creation and patching of AMIs.

## üõ° IAM Role for EC2

* Allows EC2 to interact with S3, DynamoDB, etc. securely.
* No need to store access keys on instance.

---

## üìù Hands-On Deployment Plan (Sample)

1. Create custom VPC (or use default)
2. Create security group allowing SSH (22) and HTTP (80)
3. Launch EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2
4. Attach EBS volume
5. Install NGINX and host sample site
6. Allocate and attach Elastic IP
7. Optional: Add ELB and ASG for scaling
