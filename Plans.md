> 🛠️ **Project:** Deploy full-stack app (React + Spring Boot + RDS) on EC2 using NGINX reverse proxy.

---

### 🐳 Phase 4: ECS (Elastic Container Service) (1 Week)

**🎯 Goal:** Run Docker containers in the cloud — no servers to manage.

| ✅ Learn                    | 📚 Do                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Push image to **ECR**      | `docker push` to AWS         |
| ECS Fargate vs EC2 mode    | Use Fargate for simplicity   |
| Task Definitions, Services | Define how containers run    |
| ALB with ECS               | Expose container to internet |

> 🛠️ **Project:** Deploy Dockerized app using ECS + ECR + ALB.
